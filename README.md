# üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è VirtualPatient-Unity
## üî¨ Background
The Virtual Patient Unity Project was created at the University of Newcastle and I was awarded a CESE Summer Research Scholarship to help with this research. Under supervision and collaboration with Dr. Peter Summons (UoN), Mira Park (UTAS), and Soonja Yeom (UTAS) with special help from Harris Saleem (UoN), my project is to replicate the software functionality required to implement a new VP in a new health domain (acute pain assessment and management) using a contemporary software web platform (C# and Unity, with SQL server as the database/knowledgebase). 

## üß¨ Future Actions
It will be a part of an ongoing current research project being conducted by academics at UoN, the University of Tasmania, the University of South Australia, and John Hunter Hospital. Working with academics and project students from the University of Tasmania, we developed a basic VP image scenario using the Unity game engine, which will be used for the current project work. The domain knowledge base will be implemented in SQL Server. It will be created in conjunction with Nursing academics at the University of Newcastle and the University of South Australia, who will also provide testing and feedback of its efficacy in the new health domain.
